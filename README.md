Welcome to my sports analysis and data Science Repository where I combine my interests in sports and Data Science. These projects relate to variety of sports genres and topics that relate to my interests. Whether its Analyizing my favorite Team, the Houston Astros or Tracking my progress to shoot under 100 in golf. All analysis are done in Jupyter nb and each project notebook is filed in its own folder in this repository.
